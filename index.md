I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Tampere University, Finland. I'm currently working on the (mathematical, and probabilistic) study of side-channel analysis applied to both existing and emerging cryptosystems. 

I have also interest on the cryptanalysis and secure C-code implementations of elliptic-curve and isogeny based cryptographic protocols.

I got a bachelor degree on marhematics in 2013 at [https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/](Faculty of Mathematics of the Autonomous University of Yucatan) but I moved to computer sciences for the master and Ph.D. degrees, both of them were coursed at the [https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/en](Cinvestav - IPN).
