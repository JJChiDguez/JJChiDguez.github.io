I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Tampere University, Finland. I'm currently working on the (mathematical, and probabilistic) study of side-channel analysis applied to both existing and emerging cryptosystems. 

I have also interest on the cryptanalysis and secure C-code implementations of elliptic-curve and isogeny based cryptographic protocols.
