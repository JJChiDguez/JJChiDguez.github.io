# Software Collaborations

Most of my software contributions can be accessed on [My **GitHub** Profile](https://github.com/JJChiDguez). But there is a couple of external repositories where I have collaborated. I list them:

1. **pqc-engineering-ssec-23** [&#128279;](https://github.com/Crypto-TII/pqc-engineering-ssec-23): Let us walk on the 3-isogeny graph: efficient, fast, and simple
2. **pqc-duit-reloaded** [&#128279;](https://github.com/Crypto-TII/pqc-duit-reloaded): Don't Use It Twice: Reloaded!
3. **kemtls-secsidh** [&#128279;](https://github.com/kemtls-secsidh): Optimizations and Practicality of High-Security CSIDH
4. **SIPFD** [&#128279;](https://github.com/TheSIPFDTeam/SIPFD): Supersingular Fixed Degree Isogeny Path problem
5. **Faulty isogenies** [&#128279;](https://github.com/FaultyIsogenies/faulty-isogeny-code): a new kind of leakage
6. **A formula for disaster** [&#128279;](https://github.com/crocs-muni/formula-for-disaster): a unified approach to elliptic curve special-point-based attacks
7. **sibc** [&#128279;](https://pypi.org/project/sibc/) (latest version here [&#128279;](https://github.com/JJChiDguez/sibc)): a python3-code library dedicated to **s**upersingular **i**sogeny-**b**ased **c**ryptography constructions
8. **Fully projective radical isogenies in constant-time** [&#128279;](https://github.com/Krijn-math/Constant-time-CSURF-CRADS): a constant-time Python-code implementation of CSURF and the radical isogeny procedures
9. **ECCKiila** [&#128279;](https://gitlab.com/nisec/ecckiila): a dynamic ECC SW stacks generator w/good security properties and fast performance, which includes rigging for downstream projects such as [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/), [gost-engine](https://github.com/gost-engine/engine), [NSS](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/), etc
