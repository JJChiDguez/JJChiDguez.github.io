# This is my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [Tampere University, Finland](https://www.tuni.fi/en). I'm currently working on the (mathematical, and probabilistic) study of side-channel analysis applied to both existing and emerging cryptosystems. 

I have also an interest in the cryptanalysis and secure C-code implementations of elliptic-curve and isogeny-based cryptographic protocols.

I got a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 2013 at the [Faculty of Mathematics of the Autonomous University of Yucatan](https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/). I moved to computer sciences for the master's and Ph.D. degrees, both of them were coursed at the [Cinvestav - IPN](https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/en).
