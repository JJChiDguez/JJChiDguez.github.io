# This is my personal blog!
## Jesus-Javier Chi-Dominguez
I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Tampere University, Finland. I'm currently working on the (mathematical, and probabilistic) study of side-channel analysis applied to both existing and emerging cryptosystems. 

I have also an interest in the cryptanalysis and secure C-code implementations of elliptic-curve and isogeny-based cryptographic protocols.

I got a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 2013 at the [Faculty of Mathematics of the Autonomous University of Yucatan](https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/). I moved to computer sciences for the master's and Ph.D. degrees, both of them were coursed at the [Cinvestav - IPN](https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/en).

You can check the papers where I have collaborated by checking my [google scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a3bmRrwAAAAJ) or [![ORCID iD icon](https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png) https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9753-7263](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9753-7263). Maybe you want to take a look at some of my [slides](slides.md).

I am used to playing guitar and watching Anime (Japanese cartoons) in my free time; additionally, I am starting to playing the violin.
