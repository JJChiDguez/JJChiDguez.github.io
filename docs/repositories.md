# Collaboration in software repository projects

Most of my software contributions can be accessed on [My **GitHub** Profile](https://github.com/JJChiDguez). But there is a couple of external repositories where I have collaborated. I list them:
1. **sibc** [&#128279;](https://pypi.org/project/sibc/): a small python3-code library dedicated to **s**upersingular **i**sogeny-**b**ased **c**ryptography constructions;
1. **Constant-time CSURF and CRADS** [&#128279;](https://github.com/Krijn-math/Constant-time-CSURF-CRADS): a constant-time Python-code implementation of CSURF and the radical isogeny procedures;
1. **ECCKiila** [&#128279;](https://gitlab.com/nisec/ecckiila): a dynamic ECC SW stacks generator w/good security properties and fast performance, which includes rigging for downstream projects such as [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/), [gost-engine](https://github.com/gost-engine/engine), [NSS](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/), etc;
