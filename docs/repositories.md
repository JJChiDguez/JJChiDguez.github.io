# Collaboration in software repository projects

Most of my software contributions can be accessed on [My **GitHub** Profile](https://github.com/JJChiDguez). But there is a couple of external repositories where I have collaborated. I list them:

1. **ECCKiila** [&#128279;](https://gitlab.com/nisec/ecckiila): a dynamic ECC SW stacks generator w/good security properties and fast performance, which includes rigging for downstream projects such as [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/), [gost-engine](https://github.com/gost-engine/engine), [NSS](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/), etc;
